# When Common Sense Spoke to Me

It was a weekend morning. After waking up, I went out to buy the newspaper. But as I read through it, I found myself deeply annoyed by the happenings around me. I kept muttering to myself, blaming everyone for the sins they were committing. Frustrated, I began cursing God for allowing such things to happen.



Suddenly, I heard a voice greet me. Confused, I looked around but saw no one. I brushed it off and returned to my thoughts. Then, I heard the same voice again, saying, “Hello.”



A chill ran down my spine. Childhood memories of ghost stories came flooding back. Summoning courage, I asked, “Who are you?”



The voice replied, “People call me God.”



I was stunned. Why would God talk to someone like me, someone who never respected Him? I asked again, “Who are you?”



Once more, the voice said, “I am God.”



I hesitated before asking, “Where are you? Why can’t I see you?”



The voice replied, “I am within you. Don’t search for me outside.”



I scoffed. “That’s impossible. I’ve never prayed to you or sung your praises, not even once in my life.”



The voice responded calmly, “I never asked you to.”



“Then why do people perform so many rituals for you?” I questioned.



The voice replied, “Are they doing it for me or for their own satisfaction?”



I paused, realizing the truth. “Yes, for their satisfaction. But I’ve seen statues of you everywhere.”



The voice chuckled. “Those statues are not me. They represent human qualities—love, anger, good, evil. These are all within you. I am not in those.”



Intrigued, I asked, “Then who are you, really?”



The voice said, “You will understand by the end of this conversation. But first, tell me—why are you so upset?”



I sighed. “I’m fed up with the state of the world. So much sin, even in your name.”



The voice replied, “I am not responsible for that. I am a pure being within all of you. Nothing more.”



“Then who will stop all this if you can’t?” I asked.



“You,” the voice said. “Only you can stop it. No one else.”



“At least show me the way to end these sins,” I pleaded.



“Find me within yourself,” the voice said. “When everyone finds me within themselves, all this will come to an end.”



“How? I don’t understand,” I admitted.



The voice explained, “When evolution was in process, every organism struggled to survive. You humans fought to thrive. I was not the reason for your existence. Without you, I wouldn’t exist here.”



I was puzzled. “I thought you were the supreme creator who made this world.”



The voice chuckled. “Why would I design a world filled with turmoil?”



“That’s a good point,” I said. “If everything is a product of evolution, then why are you here?”



“Because of you,” the voice said. “Humans were the first organisms to discover me, but in the process, you forgot what I truly am.”



“Are you talking about religion?” I asked.



“Is it only religion? Think deeper,” the voice urged.



“Religion… and science?” I guessed.



“Exactly. You were the first beings to become civilized.”



“Then why is our civilization in such a crisis? Why is this happening?” I pressed.



The voice gave me a clue. “I am the one who made you wear clothes to adapt to your environment. But now, you’ve turned it into a fantasy.”



“Are you talking about common sense?” I asked hesitantly.



The voice smiled. “Finally, you’ve found me. I am the common sense within you. You’ve named me ‘God.’ When envy, hatred, ignorance, and other evils are replaced by common sense, that’s me in action.”



“That’s interesting,” I admitted. “But tell me, how can I stop all the wrong happening around me?”



The voice said, “When everyone finds me—the common sense within themselves—they will realize the true nature of both religion and science. All that’s happening in the world is because of your actions, not mine. Where is my fault in this?”



“You’re right,” I said. “I shouldn’t blame you for our downfall. But how do I find you?”



The voice replied, “Many have found me before—Kabir, Christ, Vallalar, Muhammad, and many other saints discovered me within themselves. It’s not impossible. I am the common sense in you.”
