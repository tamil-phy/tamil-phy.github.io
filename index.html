                <p>Hey there! I am Tamilarasan Bakthavatchalam, a theoretical physicist turned machine learning aficionado. My roots trace back to the lively city of Pondicherry, where I first discovered my passion for uncovering the mysteries of the universe. During my school days, I was a curious collector, setting up a lab using all the fascinating debris I found on the beach, anchored to pursuing science through this hobby and my love for reading sci-fi books.</p>
                
                <p>I initially pursued a career in engineering, but after realizing it wasn't my true calling, I decided to follow my passion for physics from scratch. This decision led me to the University of Madras, where I earned my Ph.D. and explored the fascinating dynamics of nonlinear systems using analytical, numerical, and machine learning techniques.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I am diving deep into the world of AI at <a href="https://www.saama.com/">SAAMA</a>, tackling clinical trial challenges with cutting-edge machine learning techniques. My journey has taken me through the realms of Physics, Machine Learning, Material Science, NLP, and Health Care, allowing me to blend diverse fields into innovative solutions.</p>
                
                <p>But my journey doesn't stop at research. I have had the joy of teaching and mentoring aspiring minds, sharing my insights through personal mentoring and talks. I am driven by a passion for advancing scientific machine learning to revolutionize interdisciplinary research, aiming to make a meaningful difference in everything I do. My love for AI also fuels my efforts to support and preserve the Tamil language through innovative language tools.</p>
                
                <p>I am always on the lookout for interesting conversations and collaboration opportunities. Shoot me an email if you'd like to chat about physics, AI, or anything in between. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
